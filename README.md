The codes in this repository were written and ran as a part of college course in data structures. This is one of the subjects I really liked and all of the codes that are presented here are my own.  
I hope that someone will find these useful. For the person reading this, here is a two-pointer advice I would like to give you:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. For the love of God don't use Turbo C!! Use mingw/gcc. There are plenty of good videos on YouTube which will tell you how to install gcc compiler. Learn how to use it. it is the industry standard.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Don't copy codes from this repo. They are not the work of some saint. Write an algo, dry run it, and then implement it. You will learn more this way than by copy-pasting my or someone else's code.
